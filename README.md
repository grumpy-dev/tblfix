# tblfix

JQuery plugin to enable 'frozen' top and left cells which is useful for showing massive tables on small devices (or even big ones)

Example case given. This is developed for 2 header rows.

Be grumpy about this if you like but fork away instead of just moaning and check current issues if you want to fix something.
